# Blackjack: strategy

* Updated README with new requirements. Overall details from the
  previous homework are still valid, however they were not
  explicitly included here to reduce redundancy. For an overview of
  the API, for example, the previous version of README should be
  referenced.

* `test.system.Console` requires the first argument to be the
  desired game to play...

* ... as a convenience to support this, Ant's `console` target now
  requires specification of the game.

* Addition of skeletons for new game implementations (see
  `impl.game`)

* New basic test added to `test.unit.jsw7`
